# <h2>Text File Reader</h2>
A simple Java solution for reading a text file. It contains a single abstract class with an overloaded single argument method "readFile", that returns a List object of type String containing the lines in the text file. The argument can be a Path, File or String path to the file.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Download or clone the project
Generate a Jar library
Then include the Jar in the project's build and call at will.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
I suppose its a lazy reason but I did not want to have to type the code from scratch any time a project I am working requires the ability to read a text file.
